    <h2>Jibriel</h2>
    <br>
        <h4 class="h4begin1">Born in 5th of May 2008, North Sumatera, Palembang, at Siti Khadijah Hospital.
            His mother's name is "Nurul", and his father's name is "Daniel". 
            He is a great boy with a great passion to himself. He acquired many failures in life when he reached the age of 7 years old, 
            where he moved to Jakarta because his mom filed a divorce with his father. It was normal to him at first, considering
            he was still a child. But, as he took those failures, he built a better version of himself. He chose to learn from his 
            past mistakes, and 'till this day he still regrets making those descisions, and how he wishes he could've prevented that.
            At the age of 11, he wanted to go with his mom while his mom was visiting Jakarta.
